# ternary_plot
A little piece of python code to plot data as ternary plot, very useful in geosciences

**The function is called "ternary_plot" :**

*df_in = imported dataframe*

*abc_headers = list of 3 str referring to df columns headers*

*norm= 'yes' or 'no' depending if you need to normalize your data before plotting or if you did it yet.*

*corner_labels = add some labels to each ternary plot corner*

*title = a title to your plot*

*ticks = for % reference*


Here's an example of spinel composition analyzed in ultramafic rock samples from Morocco
